If growth decelerates even modestly, multiples can compress disproportionately.\n\n**Conditional:**\nIf revenue growth slows from hyper-growth to merely strong growth, then the valuation multiple can contract, because the premium was priced on continuation of extreme acceleration.\n\n**Falsifier:**\nIf forward guidance and bookings demonstrate accelerating multi-quarter demand beyond the initial AI buildout phase, this mechanism weakens.\n\n---\n\n### REASON 2 — Buyer Concentration & Margin Risk\n\n**Mechanism:**\nA small number of hyperscalers drive incremental demand and possess bargaining leverage.\n\n**Conditional:**\nIf hyperscalers begin diversifying suppliers or internalizing portions of the stack (e.g., custom silicon), then NVIDIA’s pricing power could decline, because concentrated buyers have procurement leverage.\n\n**Falsifier:**\nIf gross margins remain structurally elevated despite buyer concentration, then pricing power may be stronger than assumed.\n\n---\n\n### REASON 3 — Gradual Moat Erosion Risk\n\n**Mechanism:**\nCUDA ecosystem lock-in is strong but not immutable.\n\n**Conditional:**\nIf tooling abstractions improve and alternative accelerators mature, then switching costs can decline at the margin, because deployment frictions decrease over time.\n\n**Falsifier:**\nIf no credible competitive ecosystem gains measurable developer traction over multiple quarters, erosion risk declines.\n\n---\n\n### COUNTERARGUMENT (Steelman)\nBulls argue NVIDIA is the enabling layer of a structural AI infrastructure buildout and that demand is durable, not cyclical.\n\n### REBUTTAL\nInfrastructure importance does not imply correct pricing. Even structurally dominant firms can experience valuation compression if expectations outrun deliverable growth.\n\n---\n\n### ASSUMPTIONS\n* AI infrastructure growth moderates from extreme to strong.\n* Hyperscalers behave as rational procurement actors.\n* Competitive alternatives receive continued investment.\n* Market multiples remain sensitive to growth revisions.\n\n---\n\n### EPISTEMIC CLARITY\n* Evidence-based: Revenue growth, margin levels, capex disclosures.\n* Forward-looking: Competitive erosion speed, demand persistence.\n\n---\n\n### WHAT WOULD CHANGE MY MIND\n* Sustained upside surprises in bookings beyond initial buildout.\n* Continued margin expansion despite buyer concentration.\n* Evidence of long-term contracted demand visibility.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL CONSISTENCY CHECK\n* CLAIM matches DECISION: YES\n* Each reason supports CLAIM: YES\n* No stance shift occurred: YES"

The relevant question is profit pool growth, not abstract multiple level.\n\n---\n\n### ASSUMPTIONS\n* AI productivity gains are real and scalable.\n* CUDA ecosystem remains dominant.\n* Hyperscaler capex reflects long-term commitment.\n* No regulatory disruption of AI deployment.\n\n---\n\n### EPISTEMIC CLARITY\n* Evidence-based: Capex trends, margin profiles, adoption rates.\n* Forward-looking: Competitive response, platform durability.\n\n---\n\n### WHAT WOULD CHANGE MY MIND\n* Broad capex contraction across hyperscalers.\n* Sustained utilization decline.\n* Credible production-scale migration off CUDA.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL CONSISTENCY CHECK\n* CLAIM matches DECISION: YES\n* Each reason supports CLAIM: YES\n* No stance shift occurred: YES"
