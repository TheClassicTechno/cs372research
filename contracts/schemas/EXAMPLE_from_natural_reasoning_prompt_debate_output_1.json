The stock is priced for uninterrupted acceleration in hyperscaler spending. If that spending plateaus or grows less aggressively, multiple compression could be severe. I would initiate a 6% short position for a 4–8 month window, viewing the setup as tactically asymmetric.",

AI adoption is increasingly tied to measurable productivity improvements, which makes spending resilient rather than cyclical. CUDA’s ecosystem depth and switching costs make rapid competitive displacement unlikely. Even if growth moderates from extreme to strong, the structural profit pool expansion could justify premium multiples. I would take a 10% long position with a 12–24 month horizon.",
