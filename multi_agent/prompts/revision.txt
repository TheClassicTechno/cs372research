## Market Context

## Your Original Proposal
{{ my_proposal }}

## Critiques You Received
{{ critiques_text }}

## Your Task
Carefully consider each critique. You may:
- Adjust orders (size, direction) if critiques genuinely changed your view
- Lower confidence if valid objections were raised
- UPGRADE your causal claims: replace L1 with L2/L3 where possible
- Add new claims that address the objections
- Stand by your proposal with explicit rebuttal if critiques do not hold up

IMPORTANT: Do not change your view just to be agreeable. Only revise if the critique
identifies a genuine flaw in your reasoning.
