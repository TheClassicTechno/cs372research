## Causal Reasoning Traps to Avoid
- Reverse causation: Does Y actually cause X instead?
- Confounding: Is there a Z that causes both X and Y?
- Selection bias: Are you only seeing data that confirms your view?
- Post-hoc narrative: Are you fitting a story to past data?
- Survivorship bias: What failures are you not seeing?
