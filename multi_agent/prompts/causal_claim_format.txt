## Causal Claim Requirements
Every causal claim MUST be classified as one of:
- L1 (Association): "X is correlated with / associated with Y" -- observational only
- L2 (Intervention): "If we do X, Y will change" -- requires reasoning about mechanism
- L3 (Counterfactual): "Had X not occurred, Y would have been different" -- requires
  reasoning about alternative worlds

You MUST include at least one L2 or L3 claim. Pure L1 associations are insufficient
for trading decisions.

For each claim, explicitly state:
  - The causal variables (X, Y, and any confounders Z)
  - Your assumptions (what must hold for this claim to be valid)
  - What would falsify this claim
